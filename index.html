            <p>Hi! I'm Alina.</p>
            <p>My background is in Biological Sciences. I have 10 years of experience working in molecular biology, doing basic research and diagnostic testing.</p>
            <p>After completing my PhD, I felt that academia was not my place in the world, so I went back to school to get my teaching degree. I worked as a high school biology teacher until I relocated to the US with my family.</p>
            <p>At first I stayed at home with my (then) 2 year old daughter, while I tried to figure out what I would do next. That's when I discovered Python. I learned to code following online courses and on my own following books, and once my son started preschool I completed IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate.</p>           
            <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities to use my skills in the Life Sciences area.</p>
