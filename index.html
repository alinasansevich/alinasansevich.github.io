            <p>Hi! I'm Alina.</p>
            <p>My background is in Biological Sciences. I have 10 years of experience working in molecular biology, doing basic research and diagnostic testing.</p>
            <p>After completing my PhD, I felt that academia was not my place in the world, so went back to school to get my teaching degree. I worked as a high school biology teacher until I relocated to the US with my family.</p>
            <p>At first I stayed at home with my (then) 2 year old daughter, while I tried to figure out what I would do next. That's when I discovered Python. I learned to code following online courses and on my own following books, and once my son started preschool I completed IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate.</p>           
            <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities to use my skills in the Life Sciences area.</p>

        <p>My life trajectory has not followed a "straight line". Here is a brief summary:
          <ul>
            <li>My background is in Biological Sciences. Working as a PhD candidate on fruit development biochemistry, transcriptomics and metabolomics is where I honed my problem solving and research skills.</li>
            <li>I have experience working in different work environments. My first job was at the organ procurement institute from my home state where I was part of a multidisciplinary team and performed diverse tasks, from patient blood extraction to contacting the transplant teams and coordinating the logistics for the organ delivery to their hospital, on top of being in charge of the histocompatibility tests. There I developed my communication skills and my ability to work under pressure.</li>
            <li>I have also worked as a High School Biology teacher, using my knowledge to give something, to engage my students, inspire them and spark their curiosity for the life sciences. Here I developed my public speaking skills, and also my ability to plan and design learning paths.</li>
            <li>I am endlessly curious and strive to learn from every situation. So when I relocated internationally with my family, I was able to use all my previously developed skills to teach myself to code. I learnt Python following online courses and on my own following books, and after my son started attending daycare, I completed IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate.</li>
          </ul>
          All these experiences have led me to where I am today, currently seeking opportunities to use my skills in the Life Sciences sector as a Python Developer!
